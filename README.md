High Resolution Imaging:
The aim of the project is to write software to analyse input images and 
process them with a view to creating aesthetically pleasing images that 
have as few astronomical errors as possible

Possible Observation Targets:

Goals for 24/01/17

Investigate equipment - capabilities and limitations
Investigate software - tracking capabilities and customisability
Establish the degree of automation that is feasible
Begin process of converting code from MATLAB to C as a test of 
feasibility for writing all software for the project in C
